I was recently busy migrating a customer from the classic ASR vault to the modernized ASR vault. However, during the process I ran into an issue. This post is to explain the issue and how you can easily resolve it yourself. In my scenario, I already deployed modern vault in Azure with a new ASR appliance. 

In your classic ASR vault, navigate to replicated items and click on **Upgrade to modernized VMware replication**.

Make sure you meet the prerequisites and click on **Next**.

Select the vault, select the machines you want to move. In my case, it seems that I can't select the VMs because of the message **"Source agent driver version is not supported."**.

This is weird, considering I upgraded all the clients last week. You can even see it in the below screenshot, that we're running version 9.61, which is the latest version as of taking the screenshot.

So what gives? Turns out, the VMs simply need to reboot after the agent upgrade. So, we schedule a reboot overnight and try again the next morning and now we can select our VMs.

Next we select our appliance and click **Next**.

And our VMs are now migrating to the new ASR vault and ASR appliance.

This was a short and easy problem to solve.
