At my customer, we had 1 Windows Server with quite a slow login process. The screen would be stuck on "Other User" for about 2-3 minutes every time a new user tried to login or unlock the locked account.

After checking a few things, we noticed that the server is Hybrid AD joined. 

```PowerShell
dsregcmd /status
```

We have the server leave the Hybrid AD join with the below command.

```PowerShell
dsregcmd /leave
```

And when we check the status now, the server is no longer Hybrid joined and the login process is faster.

So what happened, that caused a slow login process with only this server? It seems there was a security incident at the provider that manages the application on this server, and that our security department decided to block all connections from this server. Meaning, that the server couldn't reach the Microsoft services anymore to perform the authentication, and it took an incredible amount of time before it switched over to local domain authentication.
