Today I started my journey on learning terraform. During the Azure login process in Powershell, I ran into the following error:

```
User cancelled the Accounts Control Operation.. Status: Response_Status.Status_UserCanceled, Error code: 0, Tag: 528315210
```

I've never had this issue before, so I was a bit puzzled. It seems that since version [2.61.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/release-notes-azure-cli#may-21-2024), that the Web Account Manager (WAM) is now the default authentication method. Luckily we can bypass the WAM using PowerShell and proceed to login. 

In this case it was an easy fix.

```PowerShell
az account clear
az config set core.enable_broker_on_windows=false
az login
```

And now we're logged in, and we can continue our Terraform journey.
